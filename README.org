Keep track of changes to non version controlled websites by mirroring them from time to time.
Use your local copy instead of browsing online.

* non html ressource
use `wget.sh`
** options
When running Wget without -N, -nc, -r, or -p, downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the original copy of file being preserved and the second copy being named file.1.

** pdf
# modified pdf
git--diff-pdf <file>.pdf
 
* html ressource
** TODO general options
  -F,  --force-html                treat input file as HTML
  -B,  --base=URL                  resolves HTML input-file links (-i -F)


** view

```bash
w3m -dump https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.5/gnat_ugn_unw/Basic-Assembler-Syntax.html
```

** TODO unnamed html ressource case
--default-page=name
           Use name as the default file name when it isnâ€™t known (i.e., for URLs that end in a slash), instead of index.html.
