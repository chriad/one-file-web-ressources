* html ressource
** TODO general options
  -F,  --force-html                treat input file as HTML
  -B,  --base=URL                  resolves HTML input-file links (-i -F)


** view

```bash
w3m -dump https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.5/gnat_ugn_unw/Basic-Assembler-Syntax.html
```

** TODO unnamed html ressource case
--default-page=name
           Use name as the default file name when it isnâ€™t known (i.e., for URLs that end in a slash), instead of index.html.

example: http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~lockhart/gpg/

`--adjust-extension` if the file ends in something like bla/bli without explicit .html
