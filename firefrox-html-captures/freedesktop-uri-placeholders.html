	      A single file name (including the path), even if multiple files are selected.  The system
	      reading the desktop entry should recognize that the program in
	      question cannot handle multiple file arguments, and it should
	      should probably spawn and execute multiple copies of a program
	      for each selected file if the program is not able to handle
	      additional file arguments. If files are not on the local file system
	      (i.e. are on HTTP or FTP locations), the files will be copied to the local
	      file system and <code class="literal">%f</code> will be expanded to point at the temporary
	      file. Used for programs that do not understand the URL syntax.
	    </td></tr><tr><td><code class="literal">%F</code></td><td>
	      A list of files. Use for apps that can open several local
	      files at once.
	      Each file is passed as a separate argument to
	      the executable program.
	    </td></tr><tr><td><code class="literal">%u</code></td><td>
	      A single URL. Local files may either be passed as
	      file: URLs or as file path.

	      A list of URLs.
	      Each URL is passed as a separate argument to
