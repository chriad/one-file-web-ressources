longer necessary.  There are two distinct kinds of allocations that a
typical programming language run-time system performs.  One kind is
for the environment; this follows a push-and-pop discipline consistent
with the nature of static scope.  Returning from a procedure returns
that procedure&rsquo;s allocated environment space for subsequent use,
seemingly free of cost.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">It&rsquo;s not free!  The machine has
to execute an explicit &ldquo;pop&rdquo; instruction to recover that space.  As
a result, it is not <span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span> cheaper than other memory
management strategies.</span></span></span>  In contrast, allocation on the store has to
follow an value&rsquo;s lifetime, which could outlive that of the scope in
which it was created&#8212;<wbr></wbr>indeed, it may live forever.  Therefore, we
need a different strategy for recovering space consumed by
store-allocated garbage.</p><p>There are many methods for recovering this space, but they largely
fall into two camps: manual and automatic.  Manual collection depends
on the developer being able to know and correctly discard unwated
memory.  Traditionally, humans have not proven especially good at this
(though in some cases they have knowledge a machine might not [REF]).
Over several decades, therefore, automated methods have become nearly
ubiquitous.</p><h4>11.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.What_is__.Correct__.Garbage_.Recovery_)"></a>What is &ldquo;Correct&rdquo; Garbage Recovery?</h4><p>Garbage recovery should neither recover space too early
(<span style="font-style: italic">soundness</span>) nor too late (<span style="font-style: italic">completeness</span>).  While both can
be regarded as flaws, they are not symmetric in their impact:
arguably, recovering too early is much worse.  That is because if we
recover a store location prematurely, the computation will continue to
use it and potentially write other data into it, thereby working with
nonsensical data.  This leads at the very least to program
incorrectness, but in more extreme situations leads to much worse
phenomena such as security violations.  In contrast, holding on to
memory for too long decreases performance and eventually causes the
program to terminate even though, in a platonic sense, it had memory
available.  This performance degradation and premature termination is
always annoying, and in certain mission-critical systems can be deeply
problematic, but at least the program does not compute nonsense.</p><p>Ideally we would love to have all three: automation, soundness, and
completeness.  However, we face a classic &ldquo;pick two&rdquo; tradeoff.
Ideal humans are capable of attaining both soundness and completeness,
but in practice rarely achieve either.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent"><span style="font-style: italic">You</span>,
surely, are perfect, but what of your fellow developers?  And by the
way, the economics discipline has been looking for you.</span></span></span>  A computer
can offer automation and either soundness or completeness, but
computability arguments demonstrate that automation can&rsquo;t be
accompanied by both of the others.  In practice, therefore, automated
techniques offer soundness, on the grounds that: (a) it does the least
harm, (b) it is relatively easy to implement, and (c) with some human
intervention it can more closely approximate completeness.</p><h4>11.3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Manual_.Reclamation)"></a>Manual Reclamation</h4><p><div class="SIntrapara">The most manual approach would be to entrust all de-allocation to the
human.  In C, for instance, there are two basic primitives:
<span class="stt">malloc</span> for allocation and <span class="stt">free</span> to reclaim.
<span class="stt">malloc</span> consumes a size and returns a reference to a
store-allocated value; <span class="stt">free</span> consumes the references and
reclaims its assocated memory.

We might
begin by assuming that <span class="stt">malloc</span> has an associated register
pointing into the store (like <span class="stt">new-loc</span> [REF]), and on every
allocation it simply obtains the next free locations.  This model is
extremely simple&#8212;<wbr></wbr>in fact, deceptively so.  The problem arises when
we <span class="stt">free</span> these values.  Provided the first <span class="stt">free</span> is the
last <span class="stt">malloc</span>, we would encounter no problem; but store data
often do not follow a stack discipline.  When we free anything but the
most recently allocated value, we leave holes in the store.  These
holes lead to <span style="font-style: italic">fragmentation</span>, and in the worst case we become
unable to allocate any objects even though there is ample space in the
store&#8212;<wbr></wbr>just split up across many fragments, no one of which is large
enough.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><span style="font-weight: bold">Exercise</span></div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote><p>In principle, we could eliminate fragmentation by making all the free
space be contiguous.  What does it take to do so?  Think through all
the consequences and sketch whether you can in fact do this manually.</p></blockquote></div></p><p>While fragmentation remains an insuperable problem in most manual
memory management schemes, there is more to consider even in this
seemingly simple discipline.  What happens when we <span class="stt">free</span> a
value?  The run-time system has to somehow record that it is now
available for future allocation.  It does by maintaining
a <span style="font-style: italic">free list</span>: a linked-list of the free spaces.  A little
reflection immediately suggests a question: where is the free list
itself stored, and who manages <span style="font-style: italic">its</span> memory?  The answer is that
the free list references are stored in the freed cells, which
immediately implies a minimum size for each allocation.</p><p>In principle, then, each <span class="stt">malloc</span> must now traverse the free list
to find a suitable freed spot.  I say &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; because the
allocator must make a complex decision.  Should it take the first slot
that matches or a later one?  And either way, what does &ldquo;matches&rdquo;
mean?  Should it take only slots the exact right size, or take larger
slots and break them up into smaller ones (thereby increasing the
likelihood of creating unusably small holes)?  And so on.</p><p>Developers like allocation to be cheap.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Failing to make
allocation cheap makes developers try to encode tricks based on
reusing values, thereby reducing clarity and quite possibly also
correctness.</span></span></span>  Therefore, in practice, allocation systems tend to use
just a fixed set of sizes, often in powers of two.  This makes it
possible to maintain not one but many free list<span style="font-style: italic">s</span>, each of holes
of the same size (which is a power of two).  A table refers to each of
these lists, and indexing in the table is cheap by using bit-shifting.
In return, developers sacrifice space, because objects not a
power-of-two size will end up being needlessly padded.  (This is a
classic computer science trade-off: trading space for time.)  Also,
<span class="stt">free</span> must put the freed memory in the right slot, and perhaps
even break up larger blocks into multiple smaller blocks to prepare
for future allocations.  Nothing about this model is inherently as
cheap as it seems.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">In particular, <span class="stt">free</span> is not
free.</span></span></span></p><p>Of course, all this assumes that developers can function in even a
sound, much less complete, fashion.  But they don&rsquo;t.</p><h5>11.3.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Reference_.Counting)"></a>Reference Counting</h5><p>Because entirely manual reclamation puts an undue burden on

this technique suffers from a lack of both soundness and
completeness.  Indeed, the second assumption above naturally leads to
lack of completeness, while the first assumption points to the
simplest way to break soundness.</div></p><p>The perils of manual memory management are subtle and run deeper.
Because developers are charged with freeing memory (or, equivalently,
managing reference counts), the policy of memory management has to
become part of every library&rsquo;s interface: effectively, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going
to de-allocate values allocated by this library, and will the library
de-allocate values passed to it?&rdquo;  It is unfortunately difficult to
document and follow these policies precisely, but even worse, it
pollutes the description of the library with low-level details that
usually have nothing to do with its intended behavior.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">One intriguing idea is to <span style="font-style: italic">automate</span> the insertion of reference
increments and decrements.  Another is to add cycle-detection to the
implementation.  Doing both solves many of the above problems, but
reference counting suffers from others, too:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>The reference count increases the size of each object.  It has
to be large enough to not overflow, yet small enough to not
appreciably increase the program&rsquo;s memory footprint.</p></li><li><p>The time spent to increase and decrease these counts can
become significant.</p></li><li><p>If an object&rsquo;s reference count becomes zero, everything it
refers to must also have their reference counts decreased&#8212;<wbr></wbr>possibly
recursively.  This means a single deallocation action can have a
large time impact, barring clever &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; techniques (which then
increase the program&rsquo;s memory footprint).</p></li><li><p>To decrement the reference count, we have to walk objects that
are <span style="font-style: italic">garbage</span>.  This seems highly counterproductive: to
traverse objects we are <span style="font-style: italic">no longer interested in</span>.  This has
practical consequences: objects we are not interested in may not
have been accessed in a while, which means they might have been
paged out.  The reference counter has to page them back in, just to
inform them that they are no longer needed.</p></li></ul></div></p><p>For all these reasons, reference counting should be used with utmost
care.  You should not accept it as a default, but rather ask yourself
why it is you reject what are generally better automated techniques.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><span style="font-weight: bold">Exercise</span></div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote><p>If the reference count overflows, which correctness properties are

&ldquo;garbage collection&rdquo; technique.  I prefer to use the latter term to
refer only to fully-automated techniques.  But do beware this
potential for confusion when browsing the Web.</span></span></span></p><p>Now let&rsquo;s briefly examine the idea of having the language&rsquo;s run-time
system automate the process of reclaiming garbage.  We&rsquo;ll use the
abbrevation <span class="Smaller">GC</span> (for <span style="font-style: italic">garbage collection</span>) to refer to both the
algorithm and the process, letting context disambiguate.</p><h5>11.4.1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Overview)"></a>Overview</h5><p>The key idea behind all <span class="Smaller">GC</span> algorithms is to traverse memory by
following references between values.  Traversal begins at a
<span style="font-style: italic">root set</span>, which is all the places from which a program can
possibly refer to a value in the store.  Typically the root set
consists of every bound variable in the environment, and any global
variables.  In an actual working implementation, the implementor must
be careful to also note ephemeral values such as references in
registers.  From this root set, the algorithm walks all accessible
values using a variety of algorithms that are usually variations on
depth-first search<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Depth-first search is generally
preferred because it works well with stack-based implementations.  Of
course, you might (and should) wonder where the <span class="Smaller">GC</span>&rsquo;s own stack is
stored!</span></span></span> to identify everything that is <span style="font-style: italic">live</span> (i.e.,
usable through some sequence of program operations).  Everything else,
by definition, is garbage.  Again, different algorithms address the
recovery of this space in different ways.</p><h5>11.4.2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Truth_and_.Provability)"></a>Truth and Provability</h5><p>If you read carefully, you&rsquo;ll notice that I slipped an
<span style="font-style: italic">algorithm</span> into the above description.  This is an
<span style="font-style: italic">implementation detail</span>, not part of the <span style="font-style: italic">specification</span>!
Indeed, the specification of garbage collection is in terms of
<span style="font-style: italic">truth</span>: we want to collect precisely all the values that are
garbage, no more and no less.  But we cannot obtain truth for any
Turing-complete programming language, so we must settle for
<span style="font-style: italic">provability</span>.  And the style of algorithm described above gives
us an efficient &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of liveness, rendering the complement
garbage.  There are of course variations on this scheme that enable us
to collect more or less garbage, which correspond to different
<span style="font-style: italic">strengths</span> of proof a value&rsquo;s &ldquo;garbageness&rdquo;.</p><p>This last remark highlights a weakness of the strict specification,
which says nothing about how much garbage should be collected.  It
is actually useful to think about the extreme cases.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara"><span style="font-weight: bold">Do Now!</span></div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote><p>It is trivial to define a sound garbage collection strategy.

anything that is live.  The one way to be absolutely certain of this
is to <span style="font-style: italic">collect no garbage at all</span>.  Dually, the trivial complete
<span class="Smaller">GC</span> collects <span style="font-style: italic">everything</span>.  Obviously neither of these is useful
(and the latter is certain to be highly dangerous).  But this
highlights that in practice, we want a <span class="Smaller">GC</span> that is not only sound but

the other about the language&rsquo;s semantics.
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ol><li><p>When confronted with a value, the <span class="Smaller">GC</span> needs to know what

know:</p><ol><li><p>that this is a <span class="stt">cons</span> cell; and hence,</p></li><li><p>that the <span class="stt">first</span> is at, say, a four byte offset, and</p></li><li><p>that the <span class="stt">rest</span> is at, say, an eight byte offset.</p></li></ol><p>Obviously, this property must hold recursively, thus enabling a

property are subtle, as we discuss below [REF].</p></li></ol></div></p><h4>11.5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Convervative_.Garbage_.Collection)"></a>Convervative Garbage Collection</h4><p>We&rsquo;ve explained that the typical root set consists of the environment,
global variables, and some choice ephemerals.  Where else might
references reside?</p><p>In most languages, nowhere else.  But some languages (I&rsquo;m looking at
you, C and C++) allow references to be turned into arbitrary numbers,
and arbitrary numbers to be turned back into references.  As a result,
in principle, <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> numeric value in the program (which, because
of the nature of C and C++&rsquo;s types, virtually <span style="font-style: italic">any</span> value in the
program) could potentially be treated as a reference.</p><p>This is problematic for two reasons.  First, it means the <span class="Smaller">GC</span> can no
longer limit its attention to the small root set; instead, the entire
store is now potentially the root set.  Second, if the <span class="Smaller">GC</span> tries to
modify the object in any way&#8212;<wbr></wbr>e.g., to record a &ldquo;visited&rdquo; bit
during traversal&#8212;<wbr></wbr>then it is potentially changing
<span style="font-style: italic">non-reference</span> values: e.g., it might actually be changing an
innocent numeric constant in the program.  As a result, the particular
confluence of features in languages like C and C++ conspire to make
sound, efficient <span class="Smaller">GC</span> extremely difficult.</p><p>But not impossible.  A stimulating line of research called
<span style="font-style: italic">conservative</span> <span class="Smaller">GC</span> has managed to create reasonably effective <span class="Smaller">GC</span>
systems for such languages.  The principle behind conservative <span class="Smaller">GC</span>
notes that, while in principle every store location might be a root,
in practice many of them are not.  It then proceeds through a series
of increasingly clever observations to deduce what must <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> be
a reference (the opposite of a traditional <span class="Smaller">GC</span>) and can hence be
safely <span style="font-style: italic">ignored</span>: for instance, on a word-aligned architecture,
no odd number can never be a reference.  By skipping most of the store,
by making some basic assumptions about program behavior (e.g., that it
will not manufacture certain kinds of references), and by being
careful to not modify the store&#8212;<wbr></wbr>e.g., changing bits in values, or
moving data around&#8212;<wbr></wbr>it can actually yield a reasonably effective <span class="Smaller">GC</span>
strategy.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Nevertheless, it is a bit of a dog walking on
its hind legs.</span></span></span></p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Conservative <span class="Smaller">GC</span> is often popular with programming language
implementations that are written in, or rely on a base of code in, C
or C++.  For instance, early versions of Racket relied exclusively on
it.  There are many good reasons for this:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ol><li><p>It offers a quick bootstrapping technique, so the language
implementor can focus on other, more innovative, features.</p></li><li><p>A language that controls all references (as Racket does) can
easily create memory representations that are especially conducive
to increasing the effectiveness of the GC (e.g., padding all true
numbers with a one in the least-significant-bit).</p></li><li><p>It enables easy interoperation with useful libraries written
in C and C++ (provided, of course, that they too meet the
expectations of the technique).</p></li></ol></div></p><p>A word on vocabulary is in order.  As we have argued [REF], <span style="font-style: italic">all</span>
practical <span class="Smaller">GC</span> techniques are &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; in that they approximate
truth with reachability.  The word &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; has, however,
become a term-of-art to refer to a <span class="Smaller">GC</span> technique that operates in an
<span style="font-style: italic">uncooperative</span> (and hopefully not <span style="font-style: italic">hostile</span>) run-time
system.</p><h4>11.6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Precise_.Garbage_.Collection)"></a>Precise Garbage Collection</h4><p>In conventional <span class="Smaller">GC</span> terminology, the opposite of &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; is
<span style="font-style: italic">precise</span>.  This, too, is a misnomer, because a <span class="Smaller">GC</span> cannot be
precise, i.e., both sound and complete.  Rather, precision here is a
statement about the ability to identify references: when confronted
with a value, a precise <span class="Smaller">GC</span> knows exactly what is and isn&rsquo;t a
reference, and where the references are.  This removes the monumental
effort that a conservative <span class="Smaller">GC</span> has to put into guessing non-references
(and hoping to eliminate as many potential references as possible
through this process).</p><p>Within the space of precise <span class="Smaller">GC</span>, which is what most contemporary
language run-time systems use, there is a wide range of implementation
techniques.  I refer you to
