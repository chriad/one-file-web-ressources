<h1>About the Author</h1> 
<P>David Lamkins was born in Watervliet, New York. Very little is known about 
his childhood except that he started taking things apart as soon as he could hold 
a screwdriver. It wasn't until David reached the age of twelve that he started 
putting things back together. David's favorite movie is <i>"The Empire Strikes 
Back,"</i> and his favorite pastime (when not trying to find the precise blend of 
science fiction, heavy metal music, AI technology, and programming technique 
to create the Ultimate Application) is to study the effect of industrial-age mind 
sets on the organization and performance of information-age enterprises.</P>
